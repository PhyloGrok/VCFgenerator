# VCFgenerator
Automated variant calling and Shiny dashboard for NextGen evolutionary genomics.<br>

Environment: Ubuntu 20.02 VM configured with required software packages described in OmicsVMconfigure (https://github.com/PhyloGrok/OmicsVMconfigure)

## Usage
1. Gitclone VCFgenerator repository into your Ubuntu 20.02 Linux user/home directory.
2. Run the command ```py VCFgenerator/Python_Hub/Controller.py```
3. User will be prompted for 4 inputs: 1) designated project directory name (string), 2) Reference species ncbi txid (integer), 3) NCBI BioProject ID (string, starts with PRJNA), and 4) directory for results.
